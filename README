Development environment:

Python supports "Virtual Enverionments" that keep all the dependencies we install isolated from anything else on your computer.

There's a helper script to run this. Just run:

. activate-virtualenv

Then, anything else you install with the python package manager "pip" will be kept in this folder, and only available when this virtual environment is active.
