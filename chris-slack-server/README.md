# chris slack server

Code for the web server server that the *Chris Demo App* slack app will use.

This tutorial was used to get me started:
[https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-python](https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-python)

The tutorial mentioned above explains how to start this server and setup your slack app to use it.

## Modifications

I wanted to be able to include my own endpoints along with the handlers for /slack/events endpoint calls.

I saw an article that gave me some understanding about how this could be done:
