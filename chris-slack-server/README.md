# chris slack server

Code for the web server that the *Chris Demo App* slack app will use.

<!-- 
## Getting started
*Any commands to be entered in a command-line interface (CLI) mentioned in the steps below should be performed while the CLI is running from the same directory as this README.*

1. Activate the included [Python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) by running the following command in your command-line interface (CLI):
    
    ```
        source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    You should now see that your command line prompt will start with `(.venv)`

    *This will enable us run our Python web server in the next step without having to worry about installing all the necessary dependencies for the server on our computer (these dependecies will already be provided from the `.venv` folder located in this directory).*

This tutorial was used to get me started:

The tutorial mentioned above explains how to start this server and setup your slack app to use it.

## Modifications

I wanted to be able to include my own endpoints along with the handlers for /slack/events endpoint calls.

I saw an article that gave me some understanding about how this could be done:
